## Features ✨
- Easily calculate the border-radius of your choice.
- Enjoy it on any device.

## Tech Stack 🪄
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

## What I've learned 🎓
- Be able to create a dynamic tool!
- Simplify the code if possible. At the beginning I had created a selector for the type of border radius you wanted to know. That meant that I had to have the tool in duplicate, having almost the same code twice. After a lot of thought I was able to simplify it and I think it is pretty good.

## What I used 🛠️
- CSS modules.
- Fluid typography.
- Self hosted fonts.
- [VisuallyHidden](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/react-components/visually-hidden/) component.

## Going further 🚀
These would be the possible next steps for this project:
- Add a code snippet to copy the code.
- Add an explanation of the formula.
